## Installation

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Setup MongoDB Atlas:
    1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create an account if you don't already have one.
    2. Create a new cluster by following the prompts. [Mongo Atlas Cluster Creation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esKNjzDZItQ)
    3. Once the cluster is created, go to the **Database Access** section and create a user with the necessary privileges.
    4. Go to **Network Access** and allow your IP address (or allow access from anywhere if testing locally).
    5. In the **Clusters** section, click **Connect**, then choose **Connect your application**. You'll see a connection string that looks like this:
        ```
        mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        ```
    6. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas username and password. Copy the entire connection string.

4. Add MongoDB ATLAS_URI to `.env` file:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    - Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with the connection string you copied from MongoDB Atlas:
      ```bash
      ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/fit-track?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      ```

5. Start the server:
    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```
    or if `nodemon` is installed for live updates of backend:
    ```sh
    nodemon server.js
    ```
